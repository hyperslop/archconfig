# HyperOS - My Arch Linux System
The goal is to save all my packages, system level tweaks, and all my user level dot files so I can effectively recreate my system on another computer, and syncronize the multiple computers state with this git repository.

To install on a new system use these steps:

### Step 1. archinstall script - Easily installing a simple base

To duplicate my system to a new computer I'll start by loading my custom archinstall script.

### Step 2. aconfmgr - Setting up packages and system level configurations

After rebooting run aconfmgr -c (/aconfmgr/folder) apply.

### Step 3. dotfiles - Setting up user level configurations

Load all the dotfiles with dotfile manager for user level configuration.

## Future Plans

* Setup a way to syncronize my game saves and emulator on different computers.
* Setup cloud server with all my stuff and keep a folder with the same organization method on all computers
* Steamdeck?

## Other

Remember to manage dotfiles and system dotfiles as you go goofball, log stuff in log.txt then check it off as you add it.

### Why not NixOS?

I left nixos because it sucks but soon I'm sure I'll try to go back but I'll configure it in on another computer like a sane person I wasn't modivated enough to immediatly tank nixOS, but the itch will not leave me the worms continue to whisper sweet nothing in my ear
